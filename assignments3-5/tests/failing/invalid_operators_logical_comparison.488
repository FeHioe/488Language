% A1 Part A Negative Testing: a program that uses all arithmetic, logical and comparison operators and fails all compilation tests
% Author: Ishtiaque Khaled - CDF: khaledi1


% Main program scope
% Code was intentionally written with different styles to add more variability for the compiler testcases
{
  var c : Boolean
  % Logical and comparison operators
  c : = 1 + true
  c : = false - 4

  c : = not true + 9 )

  c : = (true and false ( + 1) ))

  c : = true + false

  c : = 1 = 1 = true

  c : = 1 not = 1

  c : = 1 < 2 < (or)

  c : = 1 > 2 (true)

  c : = 1 >= 1 < false

  c : = 1 <= 1 > true
