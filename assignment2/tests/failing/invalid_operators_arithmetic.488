% A1 Part A Negative Testing: a program that uses all arithmetic, logical and comparison operators and fails all compilation tests
% Author: Ishtiaque Khaled - CDF: khaledi1


% Main program scope
% Code was intentionally written with different styles to add more variability for the compiler testcases
{
  var a : Integer
  % Arithmetic operations
  % Written with various whitespaces between operators and variables
  a :: = 1

  a : -1

  a := --1+1

  a : = 1-1

  a : = b * 1

  a := (1 / 1

  a := (1 + 1 - 1 * 1 / 1))
}
