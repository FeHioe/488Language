Introduction
---------------

In this document you will see sample machine code written in the form:

1: INST arg (note1)
2: INST2 arg1 arg2
3: <sequence of instructions>
4: INST 3
5: INST arg3
6: INST *X*
...

The numbers on the left side indicate the simplified machine
instruction address numbers for the example code. Code in <>
indicates a sequence of emitted instructions that have already
been described in another section of the document. Code in <>
is technically a sequence of instructions but it will only
occupy one machine address in the simplified examples. Words in ()
are comments describing that line of code. Arguments in ** are compile
time known constants.

Address patching will not be explicitly discussed in the below code
templates. Only the final code we expect to generate
will be provided.

================================================================================================================

1. Storage

All variables will be addressed by their logical address which is a combination
of their lexical level and an offset in the number of words after the control data
in the activation record of the routine they're declared in (see section 3 for details
on the activation record format).

a) Variables in the main program will be stored in the activation record
   of the main program after the control data. This will be done for
   consistency with 1b).

b) Variables in procedures and functions will be stored in the activation
   record of the routine they're declared in after the control data.

c) Variables in minor scopes will be stored in the activation record of the
   nearest enclosing major scope (function or procedure).

d) Integer and boolean constants will be pushed directly onto the runtime stack if
   needed for evaluation (see section 2a).
   Since integers and booleans only occupy one word, we felt it would be inefficient to
   store a single copy of them in constant memory above the mlp and load them from memory
   each time they're referenced.

e) Text constants will be stored in the constant memory above the mlp pointer (see section 5c).
   Text constants will be addressed by the location of the first character (see section 2a.ii).
   This saves space if the same text constant is used in multiple locations.
   The CodeGen class will store a 1:1 hashmap of text constants to the memory address
   of their first character for easy lookup during codegen. Text constants will be null
   terminated to mark where they end.

================================================================================================================

2. Expressions

a) Integer and boolean constants will be pushed onto the runtime stack
   and evaluated, The result of the expression will be placed at the top
   of the runtime stack.

   i) For example, given the integer constant -3 the following
      code will be emitted:
      1: PUSH -3

   ii) For text constants the address of the first character will be pushed
       1: PUSH *ADDR* (*ADDR* is the address to the first character which can be looked
                       up in a hash table at compile time)

b) Scalar variables will be addressed by their logical address in the form
   (lexical level, order number). The lexical level provides an index
   into the display registers to find the activation record where the variable
   is stored at runtime. The order number will provide the offset in number
   of words that the variable is located from the end of the control data in the
   activation record (i.e. after the return address). The logical address will be
   determined from the symbol table stored in the CodeGen class. The logical address
   of a variable can be calculated at compile time since all variables have known sizes.
   For example, the first parameter to a routine like 'f(a, b)' will be accessed as follows:
   1: ADDR *LL* 4 (*LL* is the lexical level of f and 4 means it's the first variable after
                   the control data since the control data occupies 4 words)
   2: LOAD
   The second parameter would be accessed as:
   1: ADDR *LL* 5
   2: LOAD

c) Array elements will be accessed by first finding the address to the
   the first element and adding an offset based on the following calculation:
   result of subscript expression - lower bound
   Since all array elements in our language occupy one word and there are no multi-
   dimensional arrays we don't need to scale the offset.
   Note: We do not explicitly check for out of bound array access, so we will
   have undefined behavior for out of bound array access like in the language C.

   For an expression of the form 'x[expr]' the following code will be emitted'
   1: ADDR *LL* *ON* (*LL* and *ON* can be calculated from the logical address of the
                      first element of the array)
   2: <instructions to evaluate expr and push it to the top of the stack>
   3: PUSH *LB* (*LB* is the lower bound of the array and is known at compile time)
   4: SUB (top of the stack now contains the offset, followed by the address of the first element)
   5: ADD (top of the stack now contains of the address of the indexed array element)
   6: LOAD

d) Arithmetic operators will be implemented by first emitting code to
   evaluate the left operand and then emitting code to evaluate the right operand.
   For the unary minus operator only one operand will be pushed onto the
   runtime stack.

   i) For an expression of the form 'a + b' the following code will be emitted:
      1: <instructions to evaluate operand a and push the result to the top of the runtime stack>
      2: <instructions to evaluate operand b and push the result to the top of the runtime stack>
      3: ADD

   ii) For an expression of the form 'a - b' the following code will be emitted:
       1: <instructions to evaluate operand a and push the result to the top of the runtime stack>
       2: <instructions to evaluate operand b and push the result to the top of the runtime stack>
       3: SUB

      2: <instructions to evaluate operand b and push the result to the top of the runtime stack>
      3: DIV

e) Comparison operators will be implemented as follows:

       2: <instructions to evaluate x = y as described in e.iii>
       3: OR

        1: <instructions to evaluate operand a and push the result to the top of the runtime stack>
        2: <instructions to evaluate operand b and push the result to the top of the runtime stack>
        3: EQ

   iv) For an expression of the form 'x not = y' the comparison will be implemented as
       x < y OR x > y and the following code will be emitted:
       1: <instructions to evaluate x < y as described in e.i>
       2: <instructions to evaluate x > y as described in e.vi>
       3: OR

   v) For an expression of the form 'x >= y' the comparison will be implemented as

================================================================================================================

3. Functions and Procedures

In general for this section of the document we refer to procedures and functions collectively
as "routines". Also PLEASE READ section 5c) before reading this section to familiarize yourself
with the layout of the constants and misc. data segment of memory.

a) The format of an activation record for a both a procedure and function will be as follows:

    --------------------
... |   Params/Locals  |
  4 |                  |
    --------------------
  3 |   Return Address |
    --------------------
  2 |   Old Display    |
    --------------------
  1 |   Dynamic Link   |
    --------------------
  0 |   Return Value   |
    --------------------

   Each number on the left side represents the number of words after the start address of the activation
   record.
   'Old Display' stores the starting address of the activation frame that used to occupy DISPLAY[LL]
   before this routine was called where LL is the the lexical level of this routing.
   The old display value will be restored to DISPLAY[LL] upon returning.
   'Dynamic Link' stores the starting address of the activation frame of the caller.
   'Return Address' stores the address of the next instruction to be executed after this routine
   returns.

    Note that the return value is allocated even for procedure calls to unify the code for
    for function and procedure calls at the cost of wasting one word.

b) Please refer to section 3g) before reading this. In the following code examples "M" refers to the
   last valid index in the machine's memory.
   The routine entrance (prologue) code is as follows:
   1: PUSHMT
   2: PUSH UNDEFINED
   5: SWAP (return value now at proper memory location and start address of this AR is now at the
            top of the stack)
   4: PUSH *M - 32* (M - 32 is max memory index - 32 which we will designate
                     as the location to store the frame pointer)
   5: LOAD
   6: SWAP (Dynamic Link field is now populated with address of caller's AR,
            and the start address of this AR is at the top of stack)
   7: PUSH *M - LL* (*M - LL* is the location where we store a copy of the value of DISPLAY[LL])
   8: LOAD
   9: SWAP (Old Display field now populated with old value of DISPLAY[LL])
   10: DUP (Top of stack now contains two copies of this AR's start address)
   10: PUSH *M - LL*
   11: SWAP
   12: STORE (Copy of DISPLAY[LL] now updated)
   13: PUSH *M-32*
   14: SWAP
   15: STORE (Address of current frame pointer now updated at designated memory location)

   The first instructions of the callee will handle allocation of local variables.
   For examples if there was a function declared as follows:

   function a () : Integer
   {
     var x : Integer
     var y[5] : Integer
   }

   The following code would be generated inside the function:
   1: PUSH UNDEFINED (space for variable x)
   2: PUSH UNDEFINED
   3: PUSH 5 (5 is the size of the y array. the size of all arrays are
              known at compile time in our language)
   4: DUPN (allocate space for the whole y array in the AR)

c) The routine exit (epilogue) code will be stored in the program section of memory and will be executed every time
   we need to return from a routine. The epilogue code is shared for all routines just like the prologue
   code. The epilogue code is branched to from the return statement inside the callee.
   The epilogue code is as follows:
   1: PUSHMT
   2: PUSH *M - 33* (address of frame pointer)
   3: LOAD
   4: SUB
   5: PUSH 4 (size of control data in words)
   6: ADD
   7: POPN (All variables and parameters in this AR now popped off the stack, return address now at the top)
   8: SWAP (Old display value now at the top)
   9: PUSH *M - 33* (*M-33* is the designated location where LL of current routine is stored)
   10: LOAD
   11 PUSH *M*
   12: SWAP
   13: SUB (Top of stack now contains the address of where the copy of DISPLAY[LL] is stored)
   14: SWAP (Top of stack now contains the old display value)
   15: STORE (Copy of DISPLAY[LL] now updated, top of stack is now the return address again)
   16: SWAP (Dynamic link is now at the top)
   17: PUSH *M - 32* (Top of stack now contains address of current frame pointer)
   18: SWAP (Top of stack now contains dynamic link)
   19: STORE (Frame pointer now stores starting address of caller's AR, top of stack is now return address)
   20: BR (Branch to resume execution caller's instruction)

d) Parameters will be evaluated in the caller and pushed into the activation record of the callee following
   the control data (i.e. after the return address). See 3e for example code. Parameters are passed by
   value.

e) Function calls (eg. of the form 'f(a, b)') will be implemented as follows:
   1: PUSHMT
   2: SETD *LL* (LL is the lexical level of the called routine and is a compile time constant.
                 This can't be done in the helper routine from 3b) because LL is taken as an argument
                 rather than from the stack.)
   3: PUSH *M-33*
   4: PUSH *LL*
   5: STORE
   6: PUSH 9 (return address to continue execution from after calling the helper routine from 3b)
   7: PUSH *ENTRY* (*ENTRY* is the first instruction address of the prologue routine defined in 3b)
   8: BR
   9: PUSH 13 (return address to continue execution from after calling the routine)
   10: <instructions for evaluating and pushing parameters (if any) as per section 2 in left to right order>
   11: PUSH *START* (*START* is the first instruction of the called routine and is known at compile time)
   12: BR
   13: PUSH *M-33*
   14: PUSH *SLL* (*SLL* is the lexical level of the caller which is known at compile time,
                   need to restore this value now that the callee has returned)
   15: PUSH *M-LL*
   16: LOAD
   17: SETD *LL* (restore the old value of DISPLAY[LL]. this can't be done in a helper function since
                  SETD takes an argument instead of using the stack)
   18: <remaining instructions in function> (at this point the top of the stack is the return value of the callee)

   This code will be emitted at the callsite in the calling function.

f) Procedure call will be implemented exactly the same as function calls in 3e) for simplicity. The difference
   is after line 17 there will be a POP instruction to get rid of the unused word reserved for the return
   value.

g) Since there is no instruction for reading display registers, we will store a copy of the current state
   of the display registers in the top 32 words of constant/misc memory. Although this design uses
   extra memory, it greatly simplifies the code for updating the display when entering and exiting
   a routine call. See 3b), 3c), and 3e) for examples of how this is performed in machine code. This copy
   of the display registers allows us to implement the constant time display update algorithm.

================================================================================================================

4. Statements

a) Assignment statements of the form 'a := b' (where b is any expression) will be implemented as follows:
   1: <instructions to evaluate operand b and push the result to the top of the runtime stack>

   i) For if statements of the form 'if expr then true-stmt':
      1: <instructions to evaluate expr and push the result to the top of the runtime stack>
      2: PUSH 5 (address of first instruction after true-stmt)
      3: BF
      4: <instructions for implementing true-stmt (i.e. the whole true body)>
      5: <instructions after the if statement>

   ii) For if statements of the form 'if expr then true-stmt else false-stmt':
       1: <instructions to evaluate expr and push the result to the top of the runtime stack>
       2: PUSH 7 (address of first instruction in false-stmt)
       3: BF
       4: <instructions for implementing the true body>
       5: PUSH 8 (address of first instruction after false-stmt (i.e after the whole false body)
       6: BR
       7: <instructions for implementing false-stmt (i.e. the whole false body)>
       8: <instructions after the if statement>

       4: BF
       5: PUSH 1
       6: BR
       7: <instructions after repeat loop>

d) For exit statements we will track the starting offset in the current AR from where the variables in the loop
   body are allocated. Upon exit we will pop off words from the AR until we are at the starting offset again.
   The number of words to pop off can be calculated at compile time. Exit statements will be implemented
   as follows:

   i) For exit statements of the form 'exit':
      1: PUSH *X* (*X* is the calculated number of words to pop off to remove all variables from the loop scope)
      2: POPN
      3: PUSH *END* (*END* is the address of the first instruction after the loop which is known at compile time)
      4: BR

   ii) For exit statements of the form 'exit when expr':
       1: <instructions to evaluate expr and push the result to the top of the runtime stack>
       2: PUSH 8 (address of first instruction after exit statement)

       4: PUSH *X* (*X* is the calculated number of words to pop off to remove all variables from the loop scope)
       5: POPN
       6: PUSH *END* (*END* is the address of the first instruction after the loop which is known at compile time)
       7: BR
       8: <first instruction after exit statement>

   iii) For exit statements of the form 'exit integer':
        1: PUSH *X* (*X* is the calculated number of words to pop off to remove all
                     variables from the integer number of nested loop scopes)
        2: POPN
        3: PUSH *END* (*END* is the address of the first instruction after the integer number
                       of nested loops to exit from which is known at compile time)
        4: BR

   iv) For exit statements of the form 'exit integer when expr':
       1: <instructions to evaluate expr and push the result to the top of the runtime stack>
       2: PUSH 8 (address of first instruction after exit statement)
       3: BF
       4: PUSH *X* (*X* is the calculated number of words to pop off to remove all
                    variables from the integer number of nested loop scopes)
       5: POPN
       6: PUSH *END* (*END* is the address of the first instruction after the integer number
                      of nested loops to exit from which is known at compile time)
       7: BR
       8: <first instruction after exit statement>

e) Return statements will be implemented as follows:

   i) For return statements in procedures 'return':
      1: PUSH *ROUTINE_EXIT* (*ROUTINE_EXIT* is the address of the first instruction in the exit helper
                              routine specified in 3c)
      2: BR

   ii) For return statements in procedures functions 'return with expr':
       1: <instructions to evaluate expr and push the result to the top of the runtime stack>
       2: PUSH *M-32* (address of frame pointer)
       3: LOAD
       4: SWAP
       5: STORE (store expr at the memory location for the return value)
       6: PUSH *ROUTINE_EXIT* (*ROUTINE_EXIT* is the address of the first instruction in the epilogue helper
                               routine specified in 3c)
       7: BR

f) Read and write statements will be implemented as follow:

   i) For read statement of the form 'read input'
      1: READI
      2: ADDR *LL* *ON* (*LL* and *ON* can be calculated from the logical address of the variable)
      3: SWAP
      4: STORE

      This code will be repeated for each variable in the input of the read statement.

   ii) For write statements of the form 'write expr':
       1: <instructions to evaluate expr and push the result to the top of the runtime stack>
       2: PRINTI

       For write statement of the form 'write text':
       1: <instructions to get the address of the first character in the text constant
           as described in 2a.iii>
       2: DUP
       3: LOAD
       4: DUP
       5: PUSH 0
       6: EQ (check if the current character is the null terminator)
       7: PUSH 14 (address of first instruction to exit the loop for printing characters)
       8: BF
       9: PRINTC
       10: PUSH 1
       11: ADD
       12: PUSH 2
       13: BR
       14: POP (pop off null terminator)
       15: POP (pop off address of null terminator)

       For write statements of the form 'write newline':
       1: PUSH 10 (ASCII for newline char)
       2: PRINTC

       These different forms of write statements will be combined until each argument to the
       write statement is handled.

g) Upon visiting a new minor scope, the CodeGen class will store the current offset of the runtime
   stack from the end of the control data in the current activation record. This will be stored
   in a stack in the CodeGen class. Upon exiting from a scope we will pop off words from the runtime
   stack until we reach that offset. The number of words to pop off can be calculated at compile time.
   in a stack structure. The code generated for handling minor scopes are as follows:

   1: <PUSH UNDEFINED for each variable declaration>
   2: <instructions for executing the statements in the scope>
   3: PUSH *N* (*N* is the computed number of words to pop off for variables declared in this scope)
   4: POPN

================================================================================================================

5. Everything Else.

a) The helper routines in 3b and 3c which are used to handle calling and exiting from routines
   will be stored in the program section of the memory along with the other functions.

   The instructions for the main program routine will be stored in the uppermost section of the program
   segment of memory.

   The msp pointer will be set to point to the address right after the last instruction. The mlp pointer will be
   set to be one less than the address of the lowest addressed text constant (see section 5c).

   We will emit extra instructions at the start of the main routine that is equivalent to calling a procedure
   with no arguments at lexical level 0 (see section 3 for details of general procedure calls). The pc will
   be set to point to the first instruction of those extra instructions.

   We will emit a HALT instruction at the end of the of main program.

b) Nothing to add for this point.

c) In this section we will describe the structure of the constants and misc data segment of memory.
   Let M be the highest valid index into the memory array.

   M-0 to M-31: This will contain a copy of the 32 DISPLAY registers.
   M-32: This will contain the frame pointer (starting address of currently executing AR)
   M-33: Current lexical level of the executing routine.
   M-34 to mlp + 1: Text constants.
